# AI & Data Quality Portfolio

This portfolio contains 5 projects simulating Safety Labeling, Search Quality, Ecosystem monitoring, and Annotation QA. 

The projects demonstrate expertise in Safety labeling, policy interpretation, Search relevance evaluation, Annotation QA, error detection, RCA, and policy improvement proposals.

**AI tools disclosure: Text samples (queries and video descriptions) were produced using ChatGPT to simulate real-world inputs.

# Project Summaries


## ## Project 1 - Safety Labeling & Policy Interpretation

1) Categories covered: Violence, Hate Speech, Minor Safety, Adult Content, Dangerous Acts, Suicide/Self-harm, Bullying, Illegal activity, Fraud/Scam.

2) Key Deliverables: 50 labeled samples, policy definitions, decision trees for Minor safety and Hate speech, actions, and rationale for each judgment.

3) Demonstrates: policy interpretation, manual labeling skills, decision-making for safety, and edge-case handling.


## ## Project 2 - Search Quality Evaluation

1) Includes: Evaluation of relevance, accuraacy, freshness, failure patterns, RCA, and improvement recommendations.

2) Demonstrates: understanding of search mechanisms, relevance scoring, safety considerations in search ranking, and ability to detect engagement bias.


## ## Project 3 - Annotation QA & Error Detection 

1) Simulates: Annotation pipeline with gold label, Annotator A/B labels, correctness, Severity, and QA actions.

2) Includes: Error taxonomy, Accuracy summary, QA insights, and reviewer analysis.

3) Demonstrates: QA mindset, error detection, labeling evaluation, BPO feedback, and data quality thinking.


## ## Project 4 - Search Ranking Evaluation 

1) Dataset: 20 queries x 10 ranked result = 200 rows with titles, descriptions, relevance scores, and rationale. 

2) Demonstrates: Safety-first ranking judgment, high quality search evaluation, understanding of user intent, and ability to identify unsafe/misleading results.


## ## Project 5 - Ecosystem Monitoring 

1) Includes: 30 vidoes with hashtags, issue detection, RCA, and improvement proposals.

2) Demonstrates: risk awareness, policy alignment thinking, and proactive detection.
