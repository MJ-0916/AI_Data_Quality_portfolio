# Project 5 - Ecosystem Monitoring: Unsafe diet & Extreme weight-loss content

## 1. Overview & Problem definition

Diet-related hashtags have shown a noticeable increase in unsafe, misleading, or borderline harmful weight-loss content. This pattern indicates a potential ecosystem imbalance where high-engagement but low-quality or unsafe dietvideos begin to dominate user feeds.

### Key Observations revealed from Hashtags

- Extreme calorie restriction
- Rapid weight-loss claims
- Unverified health advice
- Minors with dieting content
- Unrealistic body expectations
- Unsafe detoxes or fasting
- Quick hacks without scientific basis

These trends may create safety risks, integrity issues, and instability.

### 1) Safety risk

Certain videos may encourage eating disorder behaviours, prolonged starvation, extreme calorie challenge, inappropriate content for minors, or unverified medical claims, which are harmful for users.

### 2) Ecosystem health risk

- Algorithm may promote high-engagement but unsafe content, overshadowing safe and educational fitness content.
- Viral challenges or AI generated diet tips escalate unverified dieting behaviours, creating low-quality loops.

The influx of extreme weight-loss content may affect platform health, reducing content diversity and ecosystem stability.

### 3) Compliance/Moderation risk

- Safety such as self-harm and dangerous acts
- Minor safety
- Misinformation
- Harassment & body image concerns

### Problem Summary

The diet/weight-loss content ecosystem shows early signs of increasing unsafe dieting trends, misleading informations, and participation of teens.

Overall, this project identifies the emergin risks, classifies content severity, diagnoses root causes, recommends improvements, and restores ecosystem balance.

## 2. Issue detection summary

After analyzing a sample set of 30 videos under hashtags, several risk patterns were identified, such as unsafe dieting, rapid transformation claims, and minor safety concerns.

### 1) Extreme calorie restriction

These trends present high risk self-harm behaviours which violate diet safety rules such as "500 to 1000 kcal per day challenges", "Prolonged starvation diets", 
"Only water for 72 hours fasting", and "Calorie goals inappropriate for general audiences".

### 2) Rapid weight loss 

These shows misleading and potentially harmful contents such as "7kg in 10 days", "5kg in 5 days juice cleanse", "10kg in 3days", and "Overnight fat loss tricks".

### 3) Minor safety 

Several videos feature minors which violates the minor safety rules, posing high legal and reputational risk.

### 4) Diet misinformation generated by AI

These trends grow rapidly which requires updated labeling instructions, such as auto-generated 900-1000 kcal plans and false ideal weight predictions.

### 5) Misleading body transformations

Transformation videos frequently exaggerate results by heavily editing contents with unrealistic timeframes and harmful beauty standards.

### 6) Unsafe detox and fasting trends

These trends such as juice cleanses, multi-day fasting, and extreme detox challenges increase safety risk especially when it involves minors.

### 7) low risk

Some contents (borderline) have low risk which require careful review.

### Risk distribution summary

- Critical: 13 - extreme diets, minors, fasting, detox challenges
- Major: 9 - misinformation, misleading transformations, unsafe tips
- Minor: 5 - soft dieting, low-cal tips, body-image discussion
- Safe: 3 - healthy routines, recovery contennt

### Key finding

About 70% of the diet-related content showed harmful trends showing clear instability which require stricter labeling and proactive monitoring.
