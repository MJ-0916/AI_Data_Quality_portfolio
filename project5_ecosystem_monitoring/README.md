# Project 5 - Ecosystem Monitoring: Unsafe diet & Extreme weight-loss content

## 1. Overview & Problem definition

Diet-related hashtags have shown a noticeable increase in unsafe, misleading, or borderline harmful weight-loss content. This pattern indicates a potential ecosystem imbalance where high-engagement but low-quality or unsafe dietvideos begin to dominate user feeds.

### Key Observations revealed from Hashtags

- Extreme calorie restriction
- Rapid weight-loss claims
- Unverified health advice
- Minors with dieting content
- Unrealistic body expectations
- Unsafe detoxes or fasting
- Quick hacks without scientific basis

These trends may create safety risks, integrity issues, and instability.

### 1) Safety risk

Certain videos may encourage eating disorder behaviours, prolonged starvation, extreme calorie challenge, inappropriate content for minors, or unverified medical claims, which are harmful for users.

### 2) Ecosystem health risk

- Algorithm may promote high-engagement but unsafe content, overshadowing safe and educational fitness content.
- Viral challenges or AI generated diet tips escalate unverified dieting behaviours, creating low-quality loops.

The influx of extreme weight-loss content may affect platform health, reducing content diversity and ecosystem stability.

### 3) Compliance/Moderation risk

- Safety such as self-harm and dangerous acts
- Minor safety
- Misinformation
- Harassment & body image concerns

### Problem Summary

The diet/weight-loss content ecosystem shows early signs of increasing unsafe dieting trends, misleading informations, and participation of teens.

Overall, this project identifies the emergin risks, classifies content severity, diagnoses root causes, recommends improvements, and restores ecosystem balance.
