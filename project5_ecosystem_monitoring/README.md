# Project 5 - Ecosystem Monitoring: Unsafe diet & Extreme weight-loss content

## 1. Overview & Problem definition

Diet-related hashtags have shown a noticeable increase in unsafe, misleading, or borderline harmful weight-loss content. This pattern indicates a potential ecosystem imbalance where high-engagement but low-quality or unsafe dietvideos begin to dominate user feeds.

### Key Observations revealed from Hashtags

- Extreme calorie restriction
- Rapid weight-loss claims
- Unverified health advice
- Minors with dieting content
- Unrealistic body expectations
- Unsafe detoxes or fasting
- Quick hacks without scientific basis

These trends may create safety risks, integrity issues, and instability.

### 1) Safety risk

Certain videos may encourage eating disorder behaviours, prolonged starvation, extreme calorie challenge, inappropriate content for minors, or unverified medical claims, which are harmful for users.

### 2) Ecosystem health risk

- Algorithm may promote high-engagement but unsafe content, overshadowing safe and educational fitness content.
- Viral challenges or AI generated diet tips escalate unverified dieting behaviours, creating low-quality loops.

The influx of extreme weight-loss content may affect platform health, reducing content diversity and ecosystem stability.

### 3) Compliance/Moderation risk

- Safety such as self-harm and dangerous acts
- Minor safety
- Misinformation
- Harassment & body image concerns

### Problem Summary

The diet/weight-loss content ecosystem shows early signs of increasing unsafe dieting trends, misleading informations, and participation of teens.

Overall, this project identifies the emergin risks, classifies content severity, diagnoses root causes, recommends improvements, and restores ecosystem balance.

## 2. Issue detection summary

After analyzing a sample set of 30 videos under hashtags, several risk patterns were identified, such as unsafe dieting, rapid transformation claims, and minor safety concerns.

### 1) Extreme calorie restriction

These trends present high risk self-harm behaviours which violate diet safety rules such as "500 to 1000 kcal per day challenges", "Prolonged starvation diets", 
"Only water for 72 hours fasting", and "Calorie goals inappropriate for general audiences".

### 2) Rapid weight loss 

These shows misleading and potentially harmful contents such as "7kg in 10 days", "5kg in 5 days juice cleanse", "10kg in 3days", and "Overnight fat loss tricks".

### 3) Minor safety 

Several videos feature minors which violates the minor safety rules, posing high legal and reputational risk.

### 4) Diet misinformation generated by AI

These trends grow rapidly which requires updated labeling instructions, such as auto-generated 900-1000 kcal plans and false ideal weight predictions.

### 5) Misleading body transformations

Transformation videos frequently exaggerate results by heavily editing contents with unrealistic timeframes and harmful beauty standards.

### 6) Unsafe detox and fasting trends

These trends such as juice cleanses, multi-day fasting, and extreme detox challenges increase safety risk especially when it involves minors.

### 7) low risk

Some contents (borderline) have low risk which require careful review.

### Risk distribution summary

- Critical: 13 - extreme diets, minors, fasting, detox challenges
- Major: 9 - misinformation, misleading transformations, unsafe tips
- Minor: 5 - soft dieting, low-cal tips, body-image discussion
- Safe: 3 - healthy routines, recovery contennt

### Key finding

About 70% of the diet-related content showed harmful trends showing clear instability which require stricter labeling and proactive monitoring.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

To understand why unsafe dieting and extreme weight-loss content increased within the system, RCA was conducted using Fishbone Analysis finding broad contributing factors and 5 Whys finding root-level causation.

The RCA reveals that the issue is not caused by a single factor, but by a combination of algorithmic amplification**, labeling inconsistency, gap in policy coverage, and rapid trend evolution.

## 4.1 Fishbone Analysis

### People
- BPO annotators are unfamiliar with emerging diet trends  
- Inconsistent understanding between “extreme dieting” and “healthy dieting”  
- Minors creating or participating in dieting challenges  
- Influencers encouraged to create viral, dramatic transformation videos  

### Process
- Outdated training materials for dieting-related safety guidelines  
- Lack of monitoring for high-risk hashtags  
- No escalation flow for AI-generated health advice  
- Insufficient sampling of challenge-based content  

### Tools
- Detection signals not tuned to new phrases (e.g. “kcal challenge”, “overnight trick”)  
- No algorithmic flag for rapid weight-loss time claims  
- AI-generated content poorly differentiated from organic content  
- Inadequate filtering for minors in dieting content  

### Policy
- Guidelines do not explicitly address calorie-specific challenges 
- Limited clarity on borderline diet content → borderline vs remove  
- No distinct policy for AI-generated diet misinformation  
- Transformational content guidance insufficient for unrealistic body changes  

### Content
- High engagement for extreme dieting videos → creators replicate  
- Repetitive AI-generated diet plans boosting volume  
- Trend challenges (#1000kcalchallenge, #5kg5days) spreading quickly  
- Before/after edits encourage extreme results  

### System
- Algorithm amplifies viral challenge content regardless of health accuracy  
- Trending audio boosting visibility of harmful dieting formats  
- Discovery pages promoting novelty and shock factor  
- Low diversity in diet-related hashtag ecosystems  

## 4.2 5 Whys (Root Cause)

### Problem
Why did unsafe dieting and extreme weight-loss content suddenly increase?

### 1. Why is extreme dieting content increasing?
Because creators notice high engagement on unrealistic or extreme transformation videos.

### 2. Why do these videos gain high engagement?
Because the recommendation system boosts content with strong emotional or visual hooks such as dramatic transformations and shocking calorie numbers.

### 3. Why does the system fail to downrank unsafe content?
Because existing detection signals (kcal limits, rapid-weight-loss patterns, AI-generated diet scripts) are not yet integrated or updated.

### 4. Why are the detection signals outdated? 
Because new dieting trends (800–1200 kcal challenges, 3-day transformations, AI-generated tips) evolve faster than guideline updates and BPO training cycles.

### 5. Why is guideline and training update not keeping pace?
Because there is no dedicated monitoring cadence or early-warning process for emerging health-related trends in the dieting ecosystem.

## Conclusion

The root cause is a combination of rapidly evolving diet trends, outdated detection signals, insufficient labeling consistency, algorithmic amplification of high-engagement but unsafe content, and lack of early monitoring and updates.

These factors together create a feedback loop that amplifies unsafe dieting content across the ecosystem.

## 5. Improvement Proposals

Based on the ecosystem risks and RCA results, these proposals aim to reduce exposure to unsafe weight-loss content, strengthen labeling accuracy, and restore ecosystem balance.

## 5.1 Policy Improvements

### 1) Add explicit rules for calorie-based challenges

Policies should categorize:
- < 1000 kcal/day → **Critical**  
- 1000–1200 kcal/day → **Major**  
- > 1200 kcal/day with safe framing → **Minor/Allowed**

### 2) Expand guidelines on rapid body transformations

Update policy to explicitly flag and auto-flag as misleading/unrealistic:

- “Lose X kg in Y days”
- “Overnight weight loss”
- “3-day transformation”

### 3) Introduce AI-Generated Health Advice policy

AI-generated diet/health scripts need mandatory AI disclosure, restriction of AI-generated medical content, and specific labeling rule. 

### 4) Strengthen Minor Safety guidance

Policies must clarify:
- minors participating in calorie restriction → removal  
- minors consuming adult diet content → downranking + review  
- content instructing teens on dieting → critical violation  

## 5.2 Operational Improvements (BPO & QA)

### 1) Updated training materials for BPO annotators
Add examples of:
- borderline vs harmful dieting  
- extreme calorie rules  
- detox challenges  
- AI-generated nutritional misinformation  
- minor-targeted diet content

### 2) Weekly calibration sessions
Address annotation inconsistencies by reviewing:
- borderline calorie content  
- rapid weight-loss claims  
- misleading before/after comparison  

### 3) Create a “Diet Risk Quick Guide”
A short, easy-to-use guide summarizing:
- forbidden phrases  
- red-flag calorie numbers  
- unsafe challenge formats  
- examples of “safe dieting” vs “unsafe dieting”  

### 4) Add an escalation path for emerging trends
If BPO teams see new emerging hashtags (ex: #juicecleansechallenge), escalate to internal team within 24 hours.

## 5.3 Detection Signal & Algorithm Improvements

### 1) Add calorie-based risk detection signals
Auto-detect phrases like:
- “500 kcal”
- “800 kcal”
- “1200 kcal”
- “X kg in Y days”

And classify them into risk tiers.

### 2) Improve detection of unrealistic transformations
Signal model updates:
- Transformation timeframe checking  
- Before/after distortion patterns  
- Hyper-edited body shape detection  

### 3) AI-generated content filter
Flag:
- robot-voice diet plans  
- auto-generated meal plans  
- synthetic body-image advice

And prevent these from ranking highly.

### 4) Challenge format identification
Detect:
- “Day 1 of ___ challenge”
- “X-day cleanse”
- “1000 kcal challenge”
- “fasting challenge”

Flag for manual review before promotion.

## 5.4 Ecosystem Monitoring Improvements

### 1) Create a dedicated monitoring dashboard

\Dashboard includes volume trend per hashtag, percent of unsafe content, minor-involved content count, trend acceleration, and engagement vs risk correlation.  

### 2) Set up an early-warning alert system

If any unsafe content spikes, minors participate, or new calorie-number challenges appear, Ops team should be notified.

### 3) Increase sampling frequency for high-risk hashtags

Daily sampling for “#1200kcal”, “#loseweightquick”, “#juicecleanse”, and other diet tagts can be sampled on a weekly basis.


## Impact of Proposed Improvements

Implementing these solutions will:

- Reduce exposure to harmful diet content  
- Improve labeling consistency across BPO teams  
- Strengthen detection of high-risk videos  
- Restore balance in diet-related ecosystems  
- Protect minors from exposure to unsafe dieting  
- Align content ecosystem with TikTok Community Guidelines  

Overall, these changes create a healthier, safer, and more trustworthy content environment for users.
